    <h2 id="news1"><u>Omicron confirmed in nine African countries with mild symptoms, say officials</u></h2><br>
    <div> <b>SOUTH AFRICA remains the epicenter of the omicron outbreak, with experts saying that the overwhelming majority of its thousands of new cases per day are of the new variant.</b></div>
    <p> KAMPALA: Omicron cases have been confirmed in at least nine African countries, with some officials reporting that initial cases appear to be mild.
    Countries reporting omicron include: Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe.South Africa remains the epicenter of the omicron outbreak, with experts saying that the overwhelming majority of its thousands of new cases per day are of the new variant.</p>
    <p><i>In East Africa, Uganda reported its first seven cases of omicron on Tuesday.The variant was detected in travelers from South Africa and Nigeria who arrived at Entebbe International Airport on Nov.29 and are currently in isolation, the director of clinical services Charles Olaro said.</i></p><p>Five are from Nigeria and two came from South Africa, she said.In southern Africa, Namibia has confirmed 18 cases of omicron, none of which are hospitalized, the country's health minister Kalumbi Shangula said.Early evidence suggests that omicron spreads faster but initially the symptoms appear to be mild, he said.</p><p><i>"The information available indicates current vaccines are still effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalization and death.
Nigeria on Tuesday confirmed three additional cases of omicron, increasing the number of confirmed cases of the variant in the West African country to six, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control.Recent travel bans imposed on South Africa and neighboring countries in response to the discovery of the omicron variant in southern Africa have hammered the country's safari business, already hard hit by the pandemic.South Africa's tourism industry suffered a more than 70% drop in foreign tourists in 2020, with COVID-19 blamed for the drop from about 15 million visitors in 2019 to less than 5 million in 2020.Tourism employs about 4.7% of South Africa's workforce.</i></p>
<p>Britain, the largest source of tourists to South Africa, lifted its "red list" travel restrictions on South Africa in October and safari operators were beginning to see an improved outlook for the holiday season and 2022.But then the news of omicron struck, bringing a new round of international restrictions on flights.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has criticized the travel bans imposed by Britain and many others, including some African countries as "hypocritical, harsh and not supported by science."</p>

<p>For people who are running businesses interlinking South Africa and other countries and raising the economy of South Africa, that is damaging," said Masiu, sitting at an empty bar with only his partner and the lodge's owners for company."It's unfair. They are victimizing us," Twala said.
With the outlook bleak for 2022, Plachesi and his business partner try to keep the empty rooms ready in the hopes that at least local visitors will embark on a safari tour.</p>

A gravity-defying aerial performance by Dubai Police will follow shortly after, alongside a 30-minute musical showcase by Emirati singer Fatma Zahrat Al Ain, and a jaw-dropping flyover display by the UAE Air Force aerobatics team ‘Al Fursan’.</p>

  <div>
    <b> India back on top of the ICC World Test rankings</b>

  <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/nc9kev98_india-afp_625x300_06_December_21.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605">
  <figure><i>ND vs NZ: Cricket fraternity lauded India for beating New Zealand in Mumbai Test</i></figure>
  <p>One of the benefits of India's series win against New Zealand was that they are back on top of the ICC World Test rankings, pushing the Kiwis to the No 2. While they can have the bragging rights for now, in reality, it is only a notional gain, since the rankings have little meaning when there is a World Test Championship (WTC) points system which, counted on the percentage of wins in Tests, has more competitive relevance. India is No. 3 there with Sri Lanka and Pakistan ahead right now.</p>
 <p>India on Monday defeated New Zealand by a massive 372-run margin in the second and final Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to seal the series 1-0. With this win, India also leapfrogged New Zealand to go top of the ICC Test Team Rankings. Mayank Agarwal starred with the bat (150 and 62) while Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers (4/8 and 4/34) for the hosts as the Virat Kohli-Rahul Dravid era got off a winning start at home.Also, India ended New Zealand's 10-game unbeaten run in the longer formats.</p>
 <p>Several current and former cricketers took to Twitter on Monday and lauded Team India on registering a famous win.</p>
<p><i> Here's how Twitter reacted to India's massive win over New Zealand:
"Resounding win for India in their own backyard, comprehensively outclassed New Zealand on a track with turn and bounce. Complete all-round effort with Mayank and Ashwin leading the way, one does feel for history-maker Ajaz," former India batter VVS Laxman wrote on Twitter.</i></p>

  <div><b>With his latest tweet, Ajinkya Rahane announced that he will be a part of the Boost brand, something he and many others in India have grown up watching.</b></div>
  <p>On May 7, the India squad for WTC final was announced by the BCCI. However, Ajinkya Rahane tweeted about his new ad for Boost instead of that news. While some cricket fans debated over the playing XI for the championship, others tweeted about Rahane's ad. Fans seemed to tweet about a WTC century, while reminiscing the old days when Sachin Tendulkar used to greet them with "Boost is a secret of my energy" on TV. Here is more on the Rahane Boost ad </p>
